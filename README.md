# Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project aims to analyze customer churn patterns and predict the likelihood of churn using a logistic regression model with a customer churn dataset. 

✅ The Logistic Regression model performed exceptionally well, achieving an impressive **95% accuracy** in predicting customer churn! 🚀📊
###
## 🔍Key Findings & Insights

#### 1️⃣ Customers older than 50 years are highly likely to churn.
#### 2️⃣ Customers with a payment delay of more than 20 will churn.
#### 3️⃣ Customers on a monthly contract have a higher chance of churning.
#### 4️⃣ The higher the total spending by a customer, the less likely they are to churn.

###
## 📂Dataset

The churn dataset is used to evaluate the effectiveness of churn prediction models by analyzing customer data and identifying factors that contribute to customer retention or loss. Businesses can use this dataset to assess model accuracy, improve predictive performance, and optimize strategies for reducing churn
